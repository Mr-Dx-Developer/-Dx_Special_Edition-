**Hello FiveM community!üëã**\
We have created an crypto mining system for the qbcore framework. The overall idea for this script is that I have yet to find a free crypto miner which functions. Thank you to everybody who contributed to this project, I am very proud of what we have created!

**This is WIP project.**

# Key Features of this Resource:
 1. 

# How To Install
* Drag and drop `razed-cryptomining`
* In your `server.cfg` add `ensure razed-cryptomining`
* Execute the `cryptomining.sql` into your database

# Recomendations From Us
* If using `ps-housing`, we reccomend to change the price of the server rack prop to the appropriate price of a mining rig.

# Items & Images
**‚ù§Ô∏è to Markow (amsali22) for making this!**\
[razed-crypto-imgs](https://github.com/amsali22/razed-crypto-imgs)

* Drag and Drop the `images` to your inventory `images` folder.

* Add This to your `qb-core/shared/items.lua` For items to work.
